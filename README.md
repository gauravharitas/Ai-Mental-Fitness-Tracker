# Ai-Mental-Fitness-Tracker
This is my 6-Week Internship Project from **IBM** where I have worked as a _**Artificial Intelligene Intern**_
Developed an "AI Mental Fitness Tracker" that accurately tracks the mental fitness of individuals based on various factors such as Schizophrenia, Eating Disorders, Drug Use, Alcohol Use, and Depression. The project aims to analyze and predict mental fitness percentages in different countries from 1990 to 2021 using machine learning algorithms.
